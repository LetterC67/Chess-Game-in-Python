10;normal;center;White is in checkmate, being unable to escape attack by the black bishops.
12;normal;nw;       - Resignation: Either player may resign, conceding the game to the opponent. It is usually considered poor etiquette to play on in a hopeless position, and for this reason high-level games rarely end in checkmate.
12;normal;nw;       - Win on time: In games with a time control, a player wins if the opponent runs out of time, even if the opponent has a superior position, as long as the player has a theoretical possibility to checkmate the opponent.
